        """
        Loads all of the paths/urls specified (if any).

        The path can either be a single string identifying one explicit
        location, otherwise you can pass in a series of locations to scan
        via a list.

        By default we cache our responses so that subsiquent calls does not
        cause the content to be retrieved again.  For local file references
        this makes no difference at all.  But for remote content, this does
        mean more then one call can be made to retrieve the (same) data.  This
        method can be somewhat inefficient if disabled.  Only disable caching
        if you understand the consequences.

        You can alternatively set the cache value to an int identifying the
        number of seconds the previously retrieved can exist for before it
        should be considered expired.

        It's also worth nothing that the cache value is only set to elements
        that are not already of subclass AttachBase()

        Optionally set your current ContentLocation in the location argument.
        This is used to further handle attachments. The rules are as follows:
          - INACCESSIBLE: You simply have disabled use of the object; no
                          attachments will be retrieved/handled.
          - HOSTED:       You are hosting an attachment service for others.
                          In these circumstances all attachments that are LOCAL
                          based (such as file://) will not be allowed.
          - LOCAL:        The least restrictive mode as local files can be
                          referenced in addition to hosted.

        In all both HOSTED and LOCAL modes, INACCESSIBLE attachment types will
        continue to be inaccessible.  However if you set this field (location)
        to None (it's default value) the attachment location category will not
        be tested in any way (all attachment types will be allowed).

        The location field is also a global option that can be set when
        initializing the Apprise object.
