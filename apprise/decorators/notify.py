def notify(on, name=None):
    """
    @notify decorator allows you to map functions you've defined to be loaded
    as a regular notify by Apprise.  You must identify a protocol that
    users will trigger your call by.

        @notify(on="foobar")
        def your_declaration(body, title, notify_type, meta, *args, **kwargs):
            ...

    You can optionally provide the name to associate with the plugin which
    is what calling functions via the API will receive.

        @notify(on="foobar", name="My Foobar Process")
        def your_action(body, title, notify_type, meta, *args, **kwargs):
            ...

    The meta variable is actually the processed URL contents found in
    configuration files that landed you in this function you wrote in
    the first place.  It's very easily tokenized already for you so
    that you can bend the notification logic to your hearts content.

        @notify(on="foobar", name="My Foobar Process")
        def your_action(body, title, notify_type, meta, *args, **kwargs):
            ...

    Possible kwargs that may also be provided are:
      attach:      An array AppriseAttachment objects (if any were provided)

      body_format: Defaults to the expected format output; By default this
                   will be TEXT unless over-ridden in the Apprise URL

    Your send function should return True or False when complete.

    You should return True if processed the send() function as you expected
    and return False if not.
