        """
        Loads all of the paths specified (if any).

        The path can either be a single string identifying one explicit
        location, otherwise you can pass in a series of locations to scan
        via a list.

        If no path is specified then a default list is used.

        By default we cache our responses so that subsiquent calls does not
        cause the content to be retrieved again. Setting this to False does
        mean more then one call can be made to retrieve the (same) data.  This
        method can be somewhat inefficient if disabled and you're set up to
        make remote calls.  Only disable caching if you understand the
        consequences.

        You can alternatively set the cache value to an int identifying the
        number of seconds the previously retrieved can exist for before it
        should be considered expired.

        It's also worth nothing that the cache value is only set to elements
        that are not already of subclass ConfigBase()

        recursion defines how deep we recursively handle entries that use the
        `import` keyword. This keyword requires us to fetch more configuration
        from another source and add it to our existing compilation. If the
        file we remotely retrieve also has an `import` reference, we will only
        advance through it if recursion is set to 2 deep.  If set to zero
        it is off.  There is no limit to how high you set this value. It would
        be recommended to keep it low if you do intend to use it.

        insecure includes by default are disabled. When set to True, all
        Apprise Config files marked to be in STRICT mode are treated as being
        in ALWAYS mode.

        Take a file:// based configuration for example, only a file:// based
        configuration can import another file:// based one. because it is set
        to STRICT mode. If an http:// based configuration file attempted to
        import a file:// one it woul fail. However this import would be
        possible if insecure_includes is set to True.

        There are cases where a self hosting apprise developer may wish to load
        configuration from memory (in a string format) that contains import
        entries (even file:// based ones).  In these circumstances if you want
        these includes to be honored, this value must be set to True.
