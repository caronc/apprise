# For this to work correctly you need to create a webhook. To do this just
# click on the little gear icon next to the channel you're part of. From
# here you'll be able to access the Webhooks menu and create a new one.
#
#  When you've completed, you'll get a URL that looks a little like this:
#  https://media.guilded.gg/webhooks/417429632418316298/\
#         JHZ7lQml277CDHmQKMHI8qBe7bk2ZwO5UKjCiOAF7711o33MyqU344Qpgv7YTpadV_js
#
#  Simplified, it looks like this:
#     https://media.guilded.gg/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN
#
#  This plugin will simply work using the url of:
#     guilded://WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN
#
# API Documentation on Webhooks:
