## The following was added to accomodate:
#   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2216807
#
# the switch was added and it didn't work:
#  dnf update -y --setopt=protected_packages=,
#
# The second work-around was to add --skip-broken
# This also didn't work.  the final option was to download the RPMs in
# advance and just force them.
